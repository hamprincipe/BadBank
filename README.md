# BadBank

<b>Description:</b>
<br>Here I have created a Bad Bank application (described as "bad" bank because of its poor security measures and basic functionality of a typical bank) where we've used Bootstrap to configure pre-packaged styling instead of manual hard CSS coding to create a more dunamic look and feel to the website. This project helps any business owner that needs a bare-bones blueprint or outline of what they would want their bank application would look like online and is open to improving and adding more styles, etc. in the future. This also solves the problem of coming up with the idea of a business owner starting their own bank and visualizing what they have envisioned in their heads. This is only the start of the solution. It can only go up and improve from here.
